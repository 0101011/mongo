 Comparison of key/value stores
================================================================

In this directory is a simple test of WiredTiger that inserts, then
reads, some simple records in a single file.

This code is designed to match the functionality of the Tokyo Cabinet
"bros" tests, so that the results can be compared across various
key/value stores.

To run the test standalone, first build WiredTiger in the top-level
"build_posix" directory, then do the following in this directory:

	$ make
	$ ./wttest write file:casket.wt 1000000
	$ ./wttest read file:casket.wt 1000000

To compare the results from WiredTiger with various other stores:

	1. Configure and build Tokyo Cabinet

	2. Apply the tokyocabinet-test.patch in the bros subdirectory;
	this patch updates the Makefile to build wttest and to build a
	local version of Berkeley DB, updates the "reporter" script to
	run wttest, as well as fixing bugs in the reporter script.

	3. Build the test programs, using a command something like:
		$ env \
		WT_HOME=path-to-WiredTiger \
		BDB_HOME=path-to-BerkeleyDB \
		make bdbtest tctest wttest

	4. Run "reporter":
		$ ./reporter
