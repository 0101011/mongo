WiredTiger release 1.1.1, 2012-03-12
------------------------------------

Default to a verbose build: that can be switched off by running "configure --enable-silent-rules").

Account for all memory allocated when reading a page into cache.  Total memory usage is now much closer to the cache size when using many small keys and values.

Have application threads trigger a retry forced page eviction rather than blocking eviction.  This allows rec_evict.c to simply set the WT_REF state to WT_REF_MEM after all failures, and fixes a bug where pages on the forced eviction queue would end up with state WT_REF_MEM, meaning they could be chosen for eviction multiple times.

Grow existing scratch buffers in preference to allocating new ones.

Fix a race between threads reading in and then modifying a page.

Get rid of the pinned flag: it is no longer used.

Fix a race where btree files weren't completely closed before they could be re-opened.  This behavior can be triggered by using a new session on every operation (see the new -S flag to the test/thread program).  [#178]

When connections are closed, create a session and discard the btree handles.  This fixes a long-standing bug in closing a connection: if for any reason there are btree handles still open, we need a real session handle to close them.

Really close btree handles: otherwise we can't safely remove or rename them.  Fixes test failures in test_base02 (among others).

Wait for application threads in LRU eviction to drain before walking a file.

Fix a buffer size calculation when updating the root address of a file.

Documentation fix: 10% of 1MB is 100KB.


WiredTiger release 1.1.0, 2012-02-28
------------------------------------

Add checks to the session.truncate method to ensure the start/stop
cursors reference the same object and have been initialized.

Implement cursor duplication via WT_SESSION::open_cursor.  [#161]

Switch to quiet builds by default.

Fix with automake version < 1.11, use foreign mode so that fewer
top-level files are required.

If a session or connection method is about to return WT_NOTFOUND (some
underlying object was not found), map it to ENOENT, only cursor methods
return WT_NOTFOUND. [#163]

Save and restore session->btree in schema ops to simplify calling code.
[#164]

Note the wiredtiger_open config string "multiprocess" is not yet
supported.

Move "root:F" and "version:F" entries for files into the value for
"file:F", so there is only a single record per file.
[NOTE: SCHEMA CHANGE]

When parsing config strings, continue to the end of the string in case
of repeated keys. [#124]

Don't require shared libraries unless Python is configured.

Add support for direct I/O, with the config "direct_io=(data,log)".
Build with _GNU_SOURCE on Linux to enable O_DIRECT.

Don't keep the last page of column stores pinned: it prevented eviction
of large trees created from scratch.

Allow application threads to evict pages from any tree: maintain a count
of threads doing LRU in each tree and wait for activity to drain when
closing.
