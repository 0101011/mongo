 * Hash bucket entry: each references a single page.  Logically, anything in
 * the WT_CACHE_ENTRY and WT_PAGE structures could be in either structure,
 * they both represent a page in memory.   However, we want to be able to
 * search arrays of WT_CACHE_ENTRY structures fast because it's how we find
 * pages in the cache, and for that reason the WT_CACHE_ENTRY structures are
 * as small as possible -- the more of a hash bucket we get on each memory
 * read, the better off we are.
 *
 * There are lots of threads accessing these entries, including both readers
 * and writers.   Readers are usually application threads reading database
 * pages, or perhaps calling the Db.sync method.  Writers are library threads
 * doing I/O into the cache.
 *
 * The reader/write synchronization is based on the WT_CACHE_ENTRY->state field:
 * if the state is WT_EMPTY, there is no entry, and the entry is available for
 * use.  Readers first check for a valid entry (the db and addr fields match),
 * and then look at the state field.   If the state is WT_OK, They set a hazard
 * reference to the page, flush memory and re-confirm the validity of the page.
 * If the page is still valid, they have a reference and proceed.
 *
 * When the cache drain server wants to discard a page from the cache, it sets
 * the WT_CACHE_ENTRY->state field to WT_DRAIN, flushes memory, then checks
 * hazard references.  If the cache drain server finds a hazard reference, it
 * resets the state field to WT_OK, restoring the page to the readers.  If the
 * drain server doesn't find a hazard reference, the page is safe to discard.
