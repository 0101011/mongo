# The stat #defines are harder for two reasons: first, we don't care about uses

# Second, we don't use the "WT_STAT_" prefix when we call a stat macro, the stat
# macro handles that for us, so we have to remove that prefix before searching.
#
# The 4 special cases listed below are because the INCR, INCRV, and SET #defines
# are in stat.h, but shouldn't have the leading WT_STAT prefix stripped.  They
# are heavily used, so just delete them from the search.
