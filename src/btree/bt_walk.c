/*
 * There are two tree-walk implementations: a textbook, depth-first recursive
 * tree walk in __wt_tree_walk(), and a non-recursive, depth-first tree walk
 * in __wt_walk_{begin,end,next}().
 *
 * The simple recursive walk is sufficient in most cases -- a hazard reference
 * is obtained on each page in turn, a worker function is called on the page,
 * then the hazard reference is released.
 *
 * The complicated tree walk routine was added because the cache eviction code
 * needs:
 *    + to walk the tree a few pages at a time, that is, periodically wake,
 *	visit some pages, then go back to sleep, which requires enough state
 *	to restart the traversal at any point,
 *    + to return the WT_REF structure (not the WT_PAGE structure),
 *    + to walk files not associated with the current SESSION's BTREE handle,
 *    + and finally, it doesn't require a hazard reference.
 *
 * My guess is we'll generalize a more complicated walk at some point, which
 * means some or all of those behaviors will become configurable, and that's
 * why the code lives here instead of in the eviction code.
