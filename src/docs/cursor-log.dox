/*! @page cursor_log Log cursors

WiredTiger cursors provide access to data from a variety of sources.
One of these sources is the set of records in the transaction log files.
WiredTiger log records can be made up of multiple operations from a
single transaction.  One can use a log cursor to access an entire
log record, or the \c step mode of a log cursor to access each
individual operation record within a single transactional log record.

When using a log cursor the key is a Log Sequence Number (LSN).
When using a log cursor in \c step mode, the key is
the LSN and also an operation counter within that log record.

In both forms, the value returned contains the following:

- transaction id (if applicable, otherwise 0)
- record type
- operation type (if applicable, step-mode only)
- file id (if applicable, step-mode only)
- operation key (if applicable, step-mode only)
- operation value

The following example opens a normal log cursor on the database:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor

and using the key:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_key

and using the value:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_value

The following examples shows a step log cursor:

@snippet ex_log.c log step open

and using the key:

@snippet ex_log.c log step get_key

Notes:

- Performing a WT_CURSOR::search on any form of a log cursor only
operates on the LSN portion of the given key.  The following is an
example of setting the key in \c step mode:

@snippet ex_log.c log step set_key

- Performing a WT_CURSOR::next call on a log cursor moves to the
next log record.  When using \c step mode, it will move to the
next operation within the current record, or move to the first
operation in the next record when the current record is exhausted.

- Log cursors are always read-only.
