/*
 * __slvg_range_col --
 *	Figure out the leaf pages we need and discard everything else.  At the
 * same time, tag the overflow pages they reference.
 *
 * When pages split, the key range is split across multiple pages.  If not all
 * of the old versions of the page are overwritten, or not all of the new pages
 * are written, or some of the pages are corrupted, salvage will read different
 * pages with overlapping key ranges, at different LSNs.
 *
 * We salvage all of the key ranges we find, at the latest LSN value: this means
 * we may resurrect pages of deleted items, as page deletion doesn't write leaf
 * pages and salvage will read and instantiate the contents of an old version of
 * the deleted page.
 *
 * The leaf page array is sorted in key order, and secondarily on LSN: what this
 * means is that for each new key range, the first page we find is the best page
 * for that key.   The process is to walk forward from each page until we reach
 * a page with a starting key after the current page's stopping key.
 *
 * For each of page, check to see if they overlap the current page's key range.
 * If they do, resolve the overlap.  Because WiredTiger rarely splits pages,
 * overlap resolution usually means discarding a page because the key ranges
 * are the same, and one of the pages is simply an old version of the other.
 *
 * However, it's possible more complex resolution is necessary.  For example,
 * here's an improbably complex list of page ranges and LSNs:
 *
 *	Page	Range	LSN
 *	 30	 A-G	 3
 *	 31	 C-D	 4
 *	 32	 B-C	 5
 *	 33	 C-F	 6
 *	 34	 C-D	 7
 *	 35	 F-M	 8
 *	 36	 H-O	 9
 *
 * We walk forward from each page reviewing all other pages in the array that
 * overlap the range.  For each overlap, the current or the overlapping
 * page is updated so the page with the most recent information for any range
 * "owns" that range.  Here's an example for page 30.
 *
 * Review page 31: because page 31 has the range C-D and a higher LSN than page
 * 30, page 30 would "split" into two ranges, A-C and E-G, conceding the C-D
 * range to page 31.  The new track element would be inserted into array with
 * the following result:
 *
 *	Page	Range	LSN
 *	 30	 A-C	 3		<< Changed WT_TRACK element
 *	 31	 C-D	 4
 *	 32	 B-C	 5
 *	 33	 C-F	 6
 *	 34	 C-D	 7
 *	 30	 E-G	 3		<< New WT_TRACK element
 *	 35	 F-M	 8
 *	 36	 H-O	 9
 *
 * Continue the review of the first element, using its new values.
 *
 * Review page 32: because page 31 has the range B-C and a higher LSN than page
 * 30, page 30's A-C range would be truncated, conceding the B-C range to page
 * 32.
 *	 30	 A-B	 3
 *		 E-G	 3
 *	 31	 C-D	 4
 *	 32	 B-C	 5
 *	 33	 C-F	 6
 *	 34	 C-D	 7
 *
 * Review page 33: because page 33 has a starting key (C) past page 30's ending
 * key (B), we stop evaluating page 30's A-B range, as there can be no further
 * overlaps.
 *
 * This process is repeated for each page in the array.
 *
