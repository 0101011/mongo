/*
 * Serialization:
 *
 * Serialization support allows scheduling operations that require serialized
 * access to a piece of data, where the data (1) is accessed only by serialized
 * code, or where the data, when accessed by non-serialized code, can either
 * (2) be read atomically, or (3) it doesn't matter if it's read incorrectly.
 * In other words, the readers are key, and they are known to be indifferent
 * to the serialization code modifying the data.
 *
 * An example of #1 is updating the size of a file.  The size is only changed
 * in single-threaded code, and never read by anything else.  An example of #2
 * is updating a 32-bit value, because readers by definition get consistent
 * views of 32-bit memory locations.   An example of #3 is updating a 64-bit
 * value (such as the bytes allocated in the cache).  While there is a small
 * possibility a reader will see a corrupted value, the value is only used for
 * advisory actions, such as waking the cache thread to see if there's work to
 * do.
