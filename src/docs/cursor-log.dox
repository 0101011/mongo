/*! @page cursor_log Log cursors

WiredTiger cursors provide access to data from a variety of sources.
One of these sources is the set of records in the transaction log files.
WiredTiger log records can be made up of multiple operations from a
single transaction.  One can use a log cursor to access the operations
comprising the transaction log record.

When using a log cursor the key is the LSN and also an operation counter
within that log record.  When a log record is a single entity (i.e. any
record that is not a transaction commit made up of operations), the
operation counter returned in the key will be zero.

The value returned contains the following:

- transaction id (commit records only, otherwise 0)
- record type
- operation type (commit records only, otherwise 0)
- file id (if applicable, otherwise 0)
- operation key (commit records only, otherwise empty)
- operation value

The following example opens a log cursor on the database:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor open

and using the key:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_key

and using the value:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_value

Notes:

- Although the key format includes an operation counter, that
field is ignored when setting the key for a WT_CURSOR::search.
The following is an example of setting the key:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor set_key

- Performing a WT_CURSOR::next call on a log cursor moves to the
next operation within a commit record or the first operation in
the next log record (which may be the entire log record).

- Log cursors are always read-only.
