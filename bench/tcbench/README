 Comparison of key/value stores

================================================================

In this directory is a very simple test of WiredTiger that inserts,
then reads some simple records in a single file.

This code is designed to exactly match the functionality of the
Tokyo Cabinet "bros" tests, so that the results can be compared
across various key/value stores.

To run the test standalone, first build WiredTiger in the top-level
"build_posix" directory, then do the following in this directory:

  $ make
  $ ./wttest write file:casket.wt 1000000
  $ ./wttest read file:casket.wt 1000000

To compare the results from WiredTiger with various other stores,
start with a Tokyo Cabinet tree, and apply tokyocabinet-test.patch.
Then copy or link wttest.c into the Tokyo Cabinet "bros" directory,
and run

  $ make tctest wttest bdbtest # etc.
  $ ./reporter
