/*! @page cursors Cursors

Common operations in WiredTiger are performed using WT_CURSOR handles.
A cursor includes:

- a position within a data source
- getter/setters for key and value fields
- encoding of fields to store in the data source
- methods to navigate within and iterate through the data

@section cursor_types Cursor types

The following are the builtin cursor types:

<table>
  @hrow{URI, Type}
   @row{<tt>colgroup:\<tablename\>.\<columnset\></tt>,
column group cursor}
   @row{<tt>config:[\<uri\>]</tt>,
object configuration cursor (key=config string\,
value=config value}
  @row{<tt>table:\<tablename\></tt>,
table cursor (key=table key\, value=table value)}
  @row{<tt>file:\<filename\></tt>,
file cursor (key=file key\, value=file value)}
  @row{<tt>index:\<tablename\>.\<indexname\></tt>,
index cursor (key=index key\, value=table value)}
  @row{<tt>join:\<cursor1\>\&\<cursor2\>[&\<cursor3\>...]</tt>,
join cursor @notyet{join cursors}}
  @row{<tt>statistics:[file</tt><tt>:\<filename\>]</tt>,
database or file statistics (key=(string)description\,
value=(string)value\, (uint64_t)value)}
</table>

@section cursor_projections Projections

Cursors on tables, column groups, indices and files can return a subset of
columns.  This is done by listing the column names in parenthesis in the
<code>uri</code> parameter to WT_SESSION::open_cursor.  Only the fields
from the listed columns are returned by WT_CURSOR::get_value.

This is particularly useful with index cursors, because if all columns in
the projection are available in the index (including primary key columns,
which are the values of the index), there is no need to access any column
groups.

@section cursor_index Index cursors

When an index is created for a table, records are inserted into the index
whenever the table is updated.  These records use a different key to the
primary table, as specified when the index is created with the
WT_SESSION::create method.

A cursor opened on an index has the specified index columns as its key,
accessed by WT_CURSOR::set_key and WT_CURSOR::get_key.  The value columns
default to returning the value columns from the table, but this can be
overridden by configuring a projection cursor (see @ref cursor_projections),
which can access the table key columns or a subset of the value columns.

@section cursor_file File cursors

WiredTiger's schema layer can be bypassed by opening cursors with a \c
"file:" URI, using the name of the underlying file.  This can be useful for
seeing the contents of a column group or index without reading all of the
columns from the table.

For example, if an index becomes inconsistent with its primary, a file
cursor can read from the index without errors (even though some of the keys
that are returned may not exist in the primary).

@section cursor_statistics Statistics cursors

Cursors can return run-time statistics about the WiredTiger engine as
well as statistics for the underlying row- and column-store files.  Each
cursor iteration sets three separate values: a printable description of
the entry, a printable version of the entry's value, and the entry's
unsigned 64-bit integral value,

The following is an example of printing run-time statistics about the
WiredTiger engine:

@snippet ex_stat.c statistics database function

The following is an example of printing statistics about an underlying
file:

@snippet ex_stat.c statistics file function

Both examples can use a common display routine that iterates through the
statistics until the cursor returns the end of the list.
