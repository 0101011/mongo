@page testing WiredTiger testing

WiredTiger uses several different tools for testing WiredTiger, allowing
effective testing of different aspects of reliability.  The testing can
be separated into the following categories:

- Functionality coverage
- Bug regression testing
- Cross platform testing
- Static analysis
- Stress testing
- Performance testing
- Multi-threading testing

The above test dimensions are discussed in more detail below.

Most WiredTiger testing is done automatically using the <a
href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration testing
framework. This allows us to be confident we maintain support for all
platforms, and don't introduce performance regressions.

@section test_suite Unit Test Suite

WiredTiger functional testing happens via our Python unit test suite. The
Python test suite can be found in the GitHub source tree under test/suite.

The WiredTiger Python test suite is built using a combinations of the
WiredTiger Python API and the Python unittest functionality. It requires at
least Python version 2.6.

The WiredTiger Python test suite implements a set of test cases that can be
run across the different platforms supported by WiredTiger. Each test case
is designed to test a specific functionality in a reproducible way - making
it simple to diagnose errors based on the test suite.

The WiredTiger test suite includes tests that cover:
- Functionality exposed via the WiredTiger API.
- Combinations of configuration settings for WiredTiger APIs. Including both
valid and invalid combinations.
- Bug regression tests that cover previous bugs, and avoid their reintroduction.

The WiredTiger Python test suite can be run in a short period of time
facilitated by running multiple test cases in parallel.

@section testing_stress Stress Testing

Similarly, stress testing is mostly handled by the test/format tool. Stress
tests can take significant time to run, which goes against a goal of having
a reasonable amount of time to run the entire suite (that is, less than
several days!)

@section testing_performance Performance Testing

We test performance using the wtperf tool, running a variety of configurations
on every push, and tracking any performance regressions.

@section testing_threads Concurrency testing

Concurrency testing is essential for WiredTiger since we implement a number of
cutting edge, high concurrency algorithms. A number of our test tools run with
multiple threads. Three tools in particular are designed to detect potential
race conditions:

* The WiredTiger thread tester called test/thread.
* The WiredTiger stress tester called test/format.
* The WiredTiger performance tester called bench/wtperf.

@section testing_static Static analysis

Static analysis for WiredTiger is done using two tools:

- The <a href="https://www.coverity.com/">Coverity,
Inc.</a>software analysis tool; current results and historic defect
reports are available at <a
href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1018">Coverity's WiredTiger
page</a>.

- The Gimpel Software <a
href="http://www.gimpel.com/html/flex.htm">FlexeLint</a> implementation
of the UNIX lint tool.
