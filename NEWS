WiredTiger release 1.1.0, 2012-02-28
------------------------------------

Add checks to the session.truncate method to ensure the start/stop
cursors reference the same object and have been initialized.

Implement cursor duplication via WT_SESSION::open_cursor.  [#161]

Switch to quiet builds by default.

Fix with automake version < 1.11, use foreign mode so that fewer
top-level files are required.

If a session or connection method is about to return WT_NOTFOUND (some
underlying object was not found), map it to ENOENT, only cursor methods
return WT_NOTFOUND. [#163]

Save and restore session->btree in schema ops to simplify calling code.
[#164]

Note the wiredtiger_open config string "multiprocess" is not yet
supported.

Move "root:F" and "version:F" entries for files into the value for
"file:F", so there is only a single record per file.
[NOTE: SCHEMA CHANGE]

When parsing config strings, continue to the end of the string in case
of repeated keys. [#124]

Don't require shared libraries unless Python is configured.

Add support for direct I/O, with the config "direct_io=(data,log)".
Build with _GNU_SOURCE on Linux to enable O_DIRECT.

Don't keep the last page of column stores pinned: it prevented eviction
of large trees created from scratch.

Allow application threads to evict pages from any tree: maintain a count
of threads doing LRU in each tree and wait for activity to drain when
closing.
